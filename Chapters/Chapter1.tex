In 2000, following the opening of the telecommunications market to competition in Europe, France Télécom, the historic French operator, acquired the British brand Orange. At the same time, the Senegalese group Sonatel was created in the late 1980s, resulting from the merger of the Office des Postes et Télécommunications and TéléSenegal. Sonatel was privatized in 1997 and integrated into France Télécom's capital.

In France, France Télécom, quickly becoming a leader thanks to the quality of its networks, gradually unified all the group's subsidiaries under the name Orange. By 2009, Orange had a presence in more than 30 countries and served over 123 million customers.

On July 1, 2013, following a vote at a general meeting, France Télécom officially changed its name to Orange. This transformation marked a new chapter for the company while retaining a cultural heritage inherited from the public service. France Télécom's historic installations played an important role in the French telephone network, paving the way for the rise of mobile telephony and the beginning of a new revolution: the Internet.

Orange operates in several regions, notably in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean. In 2019, it was considered the leader or second operator in 75% of the European countries where it is present, and in 83% of the countries in Africa and the Middle East. Orange offers telecommunications equipment and services for individuals, professionals, and businesses.

\subsection{Orange Business Morocco}
Orange Business Morocco is a newly established entity in 2018 in Rabat, specializing in the design and development of application services and system integration in various domains. It works on behalf of various expertise of Orange Business Services. Several companies have provided application services for Orange Business Services, such as Almerys, a health third-party payer operator. OBS IT Morocco is founded to take control of its applications, optimize and rationalize costs, bring development teams closer to business directions, and improve IT solution delivery times for TTM. By following an Agile way of working to deliver functionalities regularly that create the most value and adopting a simple and automated development and production environment to focus on the essentials.

\section{Project presentation}
\subsection{General project context}
In today's world, ensuring the sustainability of IT practices is paramount. When it comes to IT professionals, it is imperative to prioritize eco-friendly strategies from the outset of the development process.

As a developer, you may not be required to master the intricacies of environmental impact assessments, as there are several reliable tools available to assess the carbon footprint of IT solutions. By integrating these assessments into the CI/CD pipeline and implementing effective remediation strategies, organizations can significantly reduce the environmental cost associated with IT operations.

This includes not only the direct costs of energy consumption but also the broader environmental impact of resource depletion and pollution. Consequently, IT teams have embraced a new approach known as Green IT, which promotes the integration of sustainability principles into IT practices and encourages close collaboration between environmental experts, developers, and IT engineers.

This approach ensures that environmental considerations are addressed at every stage of the development and delivery process, thereby fostering a more sustainable IT ecosystem.

\subsection{Problematic}

While Orange Business Services Morocco has established efficient CI/CD pipelines using GitLab, there is a lack of focus on environmental sustainability and energy efficiency within their DevOps processes. The current approach prioritizes swift software delivery but overlooks the environmental impact of development and deployment activities. This neglect of Green IT principles hinders efforts to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with the organization's IT infrastructure, particularly its Kubernetes clusters. The challenge lies in integrating Green IT considerations seamlessly into existing DevOps workflows without compromising efficiency or productivity. Thus, the problematic revolves around balancing the need for rapid software delivery with environmental responsibility, requiring the development of strategies and tools to monitor and optimize energy usage and carbon footprint throughout the CI/CD pipeline
\section{Project planning and management}
\subsection{Method adopted}

To ensure optimal progress of our project, we have chosen to use the agile Scrum method (illustrated in Fig. 1.10).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=17.5cm]{Figures/scrum.png}
  \caption{Scrum methodology}
\end{figure}

This approach will enable us to best meet the needs of the company while minimizing the risk of delays and ensuring the satisfaction of all stakeholders.

Scrum is an agile project management method that was first introduced in an article by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka in 1986, published in the Harvard Business Review under the title "The New Product Development Game". It was developed in the 1990s and formalized by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in 1995.

The fundamental principle of this method is to iteratively focus on the features to be implemented. The project is divided into functional modules that are developed, tested, and delivered in iterative sequences called "sprints". Each sprint aims to achieve a specific goal, from which the features to be implemented are chosen.

We have adapted the Scrum method to our project by dividing it into sprints of two to three weeks. At the end of each sprint, a meeting is organized with the Scrum Master and the Product Owner to review the work done during the period and set the tasks and objectives for the next sprint. If differences are noted during the inspection, we adapt the process in question. To do this, we have set up weekly meetings led by the Scrum Master, during which each team member presents the status of their tasks, reports any encountered blockers, and outlines the actions to be taken for the next period as well as future prospects. This approach has allowed us to clearly define the objectives for each increment and adapt them as needed, while also allowing us to complete or modify the list of features to be implemented for the upcoming sprints.

\subsection{Project Planning}
Planning is an essential step in project management, as it allows for defining the work to be done, setting objectives, coordinating actions, managing resources, reducing risks, tracking ongoing actions, and reporting the project's progress. In our case, we started by breaking down the project into tasks, then proceeded with a risk assessment before establishing a Gantt chart to have an overview of the project's progress.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we first introduced Orange Business Morocco, the organization involved in the project. Then, we established the general framework of the project before presenting the specific problem to be addressed. We also explained the working method we adopted and provided an overview of the schedule that was followed throughout the project. In the next chapter, we will move on to the functional and non-functional analysis of our project, as well as detailed design. This phase will define the specifications necessary for the development of the overall project architecture.
