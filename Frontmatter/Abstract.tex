This report reflects the work carried out at Orange Business Morocco as part of my final project for the engineering degree in Telecommunications and Information Technologies.

In a context where distributed architectures and agile development practices dominate application design, integrating Green IT principles into DevOps practices has become essential. This evolution underscores the increasing importance placed on environmental sustainability in the technology sector.

By focusing on monitoring energy consumption and CO$_2$ emissions of the infrastructure, we highlight a growing concern for the ecological footprint of our computer systems. This awareness has led to the adoption of proactive measures such as using Kepler, Prometheus, and Grafana to monitor and visualize these environmental metrics.

My final project aims to implement Kepler to monitor energy consumption and CO$_2$ emissions of Kubernetes, and integrate it into the CI/CD pipeline.
